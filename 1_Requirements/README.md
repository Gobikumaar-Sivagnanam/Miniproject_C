## Introduction

 * During my engineering course, there was a subject called Applied Numerical Methods (ANM), which showed the numerical methods that can be applied to solve problems like finding the roots of a non-linear function, finding the value of integration or differentiation at a point for a function.
 * These algorithms are tedious to solve by hand, so I always thought it would be useful to have a tool that could solve this for me.
 * This is the motivation for this Miniproject. Where I will try to implement the different numerical methods algorithms to achieve the above mentioned tasks.

 ## Research

 ### Need and Importance of Numerical Methods

  * Numerical methods are already being used in computations performed by computers as the algorithms are iterative or are closely related to how many programming languages define the datatypes for performing these algorithms.
  * Hence numerical methods have become important and have their own precence in the modern world due to the rise in computational capabilities.
  * They are able to produce useful results, this is because problems which cannot be solved can be cleverly approximated using numerical methods.
  * This is the reason why numerical methods are using in applied math problems, as the direct solution for such problems might not be possible. Yet we can get a result close to the real solution with a margin of error which is acceptable.
  * Numerical approach enables solution of complex problem with a great number of smaller but simpler operations, which make it a perfect match to implement with computers.

### Implementation with Programming Language C

  * C defines datatypes like double which have high precision and can be used to implement the algorithms with high accuracy. 
  * The loops and precision can be used to iterate the algorithms in an efficient manner.
